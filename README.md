# Diabetes Prediction: Deep Learning Approach

# Classification Problem
The objective of the diabetes dataset is to predict whether a person has diabetes or not, based on based on diagnostic measurements such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age and etc.

Data Set Information:

The 8 features of the diabetes dataset are:
1.Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
2.Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3.BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4.SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
5.Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6.BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)Â²)
7.DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function on genetic influence and hereditary risk
8.Age: Age (years)

The target of the diabetes dataset: Outcome Class variable (0:negative or 1:positive)

Notes: the dataset contains missing and duplicate value.
