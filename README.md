# Diabetes Prediction: Deep Learning Approach

# Classification Problem
The objective is to predict whether a person has diabetes or not, based on diagnostic measurements such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, etc.

Data Set Information:

The 8 features of the diabetes dataset are:
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)Â²)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function on genetic influence and hereditary risk
- Age: Age (years)

The target from the diabetes dataset: Outcome Class variable (0:negative or 1:positive)

Notes: the dataset contains missing and duplicate value.

# How to use it
Clone repo and run it.
- deep_learning_train.py is python scripts to train the data.
- app.py is python scripts for deployment and web app.
